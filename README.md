# [Toaster](https://github.com/UniBreakfast/Toaster)

## A Toaster library allows to easily produce toasts

Class `Toaster` creates a layer in the DOM and a `toaster` object with `.log(msg)` method to make toasts. Those are made with a secondary class `Toast`.

Both toasters and toasts are highly configurable in styling, positions, timeouts, animations, interactivity. 

Messages passed to `toaster.log(msg)` themselves can be plain strings, HTML markup or prebuilt DOM elements with arbitrary depth.

User can drag and drop toasts. If a toast was dragged it will not dissappear on timeout but can still be closed with a cross button in the corner.

Demonstrated styles are minimal so nothing limits your imagination, apply whatever styles you need.
